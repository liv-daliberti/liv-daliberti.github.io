However, one area I consistently struggled as a researcher was in writing the analysis section of my publications. Sufficient analayis was regularly the focus of peer-review critiques, and I knew I had to address that gap. Moreover, I wanted to take theoretically rigorous courseload in my first semester back to school. It has been nearly 6 years since I’d been a fulltime student, so I wanted to swiftly re-adjust to a less business-oriented, more theoretically rigorous environment.</p> <p>I decided to address the analysis issue head-on by enrolling in <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/alex-lombardi/home/cos-433533-fall-2024-princeton">533-Cryptography</a> with Professor Alex Lombardi and <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall24/cos521/">521-Advanced Algorithm Design</a> with Professor Pravesh Kothari. These course not only broadened my knowledge of advanced cryptographic methods and algorithmic techniques, but also forced me to improve my academic writing. Every assignment was an opportunity to refine how I presented and defended my arguments.</p> <p>Cryptography was a lot of fun, and I felt comfortable in the course for most of the semester. My favorite technique that we covered in 533-Cryptography is Proofs by Reduction, as <a href="https://user.eng.umd.edu/~danadach/Intro_Crypto_Spring_15/reductions.pdf">beautifully explained by Dr. Dachman-Soled</a>. I had not used this technique prior to this course, and I know that this is something that I will carry forward in my work, including in my work outside of the field of cryptography.</p> <p>In direct contrast, I really struggled with 521-Advanced Algorithm Design. My prior educational experience had not included an intro to algorithms / algorithms for computer science course. Other people around me in the room certainly came in with a lot of background understanding of the field of algorithms that I hurriedly tried to backfill. My first homework set was a disaster. Looking back, I’m embarassed as I re-read my solutions; I got a deserved 68%. It is, in fact, really hard to get back into the mindset of being a student after over half a decade in industry. Every week from early October to late November, I would ask myself if I was ready to give up. Luckily, with a lot of help from my TA and a serious amount of banging my head against a desk, I did make it through the course.</p> <p>My workload as a Ph.D. student looks quite different than my defense contracting job. I spend a lot less time trying to convince people that they should consider using an algorithm / technique within their system, and instead, a lot more time thinking about the mathematics of those algorithms and systems. Most days, last semester, I came in and just sat and worked on a given homework problem all day. Some days I made no progress. My partner calls this kind of work “skull-dragging”, and I certainly do feel like I’m dragging my oozing brain along the pathway of knowledge.</p> <p>However, this kind of thinking - algorithm design and analysis - is exactly the skillset I hope to improve during my Ph.D. Moreover, I hope to use the skills learned to ultimately contribute to the development of new decision-making algorithms. So, I’m glad to have taken the first step on that journey. The first step is often, anecdotally, the hardest to take and the largest delta of change. I hope that I’m optimizing my experience towards a reward maximizing state moving forward.</p> <p>Here are my final capstones for each of the classes that I took last Fall:</p> <p>For 533-Cyprography – <a href="/assets/pdf/crypto_final.pdf">a project on a privacy-preserving biometric authentication protocol</a>. I’d originally started work on this protocol before my Ph.D. as part of my job, and now, after taking 533-Cryptography, I’m glad to have gone back and written up the protocol description and security anaylsis.</p> <p>For 521-Advanced Algorithm Design – <a href="/assets/pdf/algo_final.pdf">a reformulation of a multiplicative weight update (MWU) linear program (LP) solver as an adversarial bandit</a>. My classmate and I showed that optimality under the static whack-a-mole MWU described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07519">Bhattacharya et al., 2022</a> for packing-covering LPs is equivalent to the optimal policy obtained using an n-armed adversarial bandit, like in <a href="https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf">Bandit Algorithms, Chapter 11</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="life-posts"/><category term="Ph.D,"/><category term="Cryptography,"/><category term="Math,"/><category term="Analysis"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Project]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why I left my great job to become a Ph.D. student</title><link href="https://liv-daliberti.github.io/blog/2024/why-I-left/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why I left my great job to become a Ph.D. student"/><published>2024-12-30T11:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-30T11:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://liv-daliberti.github.io/blog/2024/why-I-left</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://liv-daliberti.github.io/blog/2024/why-I-left/"><![CDATA[<p>I loved my job as a researcher within an AI/ML accelerator for a large defense contractor. It was a fantastic role at a great company, where I was valued both as a leader and an individual contributor. I had the freedom to set my own research objectives, pursue projects I was passionate about, and collaborate with brilliant researchers who brought fresh ideas to government research and development. And yet, five years into my post-master’s career, working a job I truly loved, I knew that I had to go back to school.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/phd.png" alt="" style="margin:auto; display:block; width:600px;"/></p> <p>The AI/ML accelerator first came onto my radar through the (now) wife of one of my undergraduate rugby teammates. At the time, I was halfway through my Applied Mathematics Master’s Degree at Georgetown University and beginning to consider how to put my new skills into professional practice—while also figuring out how to tackle the substantial debt I had accrued. She told me about the accelerator’s innovative projects with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and other ARPA-style programs. It sounded like a dream role, brimming with creativity and cutting-edge applications.</p> <p>I’d always aspired to work in the public sector, using advanced mathematics and modeling techniques to help the government innovate on existing technologies and processes. Through her connection, I landed an internship and set out to prove to the team that, despite being young, inexperienced, and a little headstrong, I was worth hiring full-time.</p> <p>That summer, I developed a working example of a <a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s10916-022-01865-5?sharing_token=I_w2TRt09iRRKA1ay2pgW_e4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6xYjgWv_6vtCj_3-jk3vNmKHcbemTO7rNY44CHEt-S0U2qKvsEocdT2DGML4FovHEwQ21Bo3FzvOHZNHVSekFVxdsMpOtrqKXK1g1_A92Vcm6B5XN8pk2Z02RA0INhRys%3D">privacy preserving electronic health record system for shared computation</a>. The system relied on fully homomorphic encryption to perform secure aggregation and linear regression computations. That project helped me secure a full-time role, and I went on to collaborate on other exciting initiatives, including <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10024980">image classification systems using hyperdimensional computing</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/large-language-model-inference-over-confidential-data-using-aws-nitro-enclaves/">secure LLM inference with confidential computing</a>, and <a href="https://aeroconf.org/conference/digest">explainability for multi-objective UAV control</a>. It was an exhilarating period of discovery, fueled by the rapid emergence of new AI capabilities.</p> <p>I also had the privilege of helping to establish our department’s intern program, which brought talented new individuals into the team. I got involved in the organizations LGBT and diversity within government contracting leadership team.</p> <p>Later, I became fascinated by the potential of reinforcement learning (RL). I helped form a team dedicated to building prototype systems to showcase how RL could drive autonomous systems, aiming to spark government interest in funding these projects. However, building these systems was painstakingly difficult. They were finicky, dependent on slow simulators, and hypersensitive to parameter tuning. Agents struggled to collaborate, and out-of-distribution actions were handled poorly. Existing RL algorithms were neither sample-efficient nor scalable, especially compared to techniques from other AI subfields.</p> <p>Despite the challenges—or perhaps because of them—I was captivated by the possibilities. There had to be better ways to learn through interaction, and I wanted to help find them.</p> <p>So, I made the difficult decision to leave a job I loved and take what felt like a step backward to become a student again. I wanted to learn how to create better learning algorithms, and I was fortunate to join a team under Ben Eysenbach focused on making foundational advancements in reinforcement learning. It was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up, and after my first semester, I’m glad I took the leap.</p> <p>Still, I sometimes miss my old job. Being a student again—particularly in a demanding Ph.D. program—can be daunting. I’m once again a beginner, struggling to learn (much like my RL models) a more optimal policy for navigating this new phase of life. It’s intimidating, and I’ve realized I’ve forgotten how to do homework! But I’m determined to succeed, create, and grow into a capable machine learning algorithms researcher.</p> <p>I hope you’ll join me on this next journey.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="life-posts"/><category term="Ph.D,"/><category term="Life-Change"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Life is two steps forward, and now, this is my one step back]]></summary></entry></feed>
