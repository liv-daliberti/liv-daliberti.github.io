My background as an applied researcher for a defense contractor gave me broad exposure to applications of cryptographic protocols. However, one area I consistently struggled as a researcher was in writing the analysis section of my publications. Sufficient analayis was regularly the focus of peer-review critiques, and I knew I had to address that gap.

When I started my Ph.D., I decided to address this issue head-on by enrolling in [533-Cryptography](https://sites.google.com/view/alex-lombardi/home/cos-433533-fall-2024-princeton) with Professor Alex Lombardi. This course not only broadened my knowledge of advanced cryptographic methods, but it also forced me to improve my academic writing. Every assignment was an opportunity to refine how I presented and defended my arguments. 

My favorite technique that we covered in 533-Cryptography is Proofs by Reduction, as [beautifully explained by Dr. Dachman-Soled](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~danadach/Intro_Crypto_Spring_15/reductions.pdf). I had not used this technique prior to this course, and I know that this is something that I will carry forward in my work, including in my work outside of the field of cryptography. 

Below, I've shared my final capstone, [a project on a privacy-preserving biometric authentication protocol]({{ "/assets/pdf/crypto_final.pdf" | relative_url }}). I'd originally started work on this protocol before my Ph.D. as part of my job, and now, after taking 533-Cryptography, I'm  glad to have gone back and written up the protocol description and security anaylsis.
