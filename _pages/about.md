I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at Princeton University, advised by [Ben Eysenbach](https://ben-eysenbach.github.io/) and affiliated with the Princeton Reinforcement Learning (RL) Lab. My research focuses on the algorithmic development of efficient reinforcement learning algorithms to train flexible and robust agents.

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked as a research scientist at [Leidos](https://www.leidos.com/) in their CTO Office Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Accelerator. I earned my Master of Science in [Applied Mathematics and Statistic](https://mathstat.georgetown.edu/graduate/testimonials/) in 2019.
